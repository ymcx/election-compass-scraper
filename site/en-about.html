  <p>If you've ever used an election compass before, this should feel familiar. You answer the questions, press submit,
    and the system provides you with the most suitable political party to vote for in the elections. The key difference
    here is that, instead of identifying the most suitable candidate, it presents a list of the most suitable political
    parties. The results for individual parties are calculated by averaging the answers of each candidate within the
    party.</p>
  <p>The primary motivation for creating this service was frustration with Yle and other election compass providers due
    to their lack of customizability. Election results are calculated using the D'Hondt method. This means that,
    regardless of which candidate you vote for, your vote ultimately supports the most popular candidate within that
    party and region. Consequently, voting for a party with high variance is not only counter-intuitive for you as a
    voter but also unfair to other parties whose candidates are less visible in the election compass results.</p>
